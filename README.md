# GitHub Actions: `checks-action` ![build-test](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/checks-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)

This GitHub Action allows you to create [Check Runs](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/#create-a-check-run) directly from your GitHub Action workflow. While each job of a workflow already creates a Check Run, this Action allows to include `annotations`, `images`, `actions` or any other parameters supported by the [Check Runs API](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/#parameters).

## Usage

The following shows how to publish a Check Run which will have the same status as your job and contains the output of another action. This will be shown predominantly in a Pull Request or on the workflow run.

```
name: "build-test"
on: [push]

jobs:
  test_something:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - uses: actions/create-outputs@v0.0.0-fake
      id: test
    - uses: LouisBrunner/checks-action@v0.1.0
      if: always()
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        name: Test XYZ
        conclusion: ${{ job }}
        output:
          summary: ${{ steps.test.outputs.summary }}
          text_description: ${{ steps.test.outputs.description }}
```

See the [examples workflow](.github/workflows/examples.yml) for more details and examples (and see the [associated runs](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/checks-action/actions?query=workflow%3Aexamples) to see how it will look like).

## Issues

 - Action Required conclusion: button doesn't work
 - Action elements: button doesn't work
 - Non-completed status: too many arguments required
